# Television-Viewership-Prediction-Using-Tweets

The project involves predicting TV viewership based on Twitter data. The first step of the project is to collect tweets about a given TV show using string matching. The sentiment of these tweets is then analyzed using opinion mining or sentiment analysis techniques, resulting in a sentiment score.

Next, the sentiment score of each episode is used as a feature in a model to predict the TV show's viewership. Historical viewership data is used as the dependent variable to train the model. By using sentiment analysis and historical viewership data, the project aims to predict TV viewership more accurately.

Overall, this project utilizes natural language processing and machine learning techniques to predict TV viewership based on Twitter sentiment, with the potential to help TV networks and advertisers make more informed decisions about their programming and advertising strategies.

In addition to sentiment analysis, the "Television-Viewership-Prediction-Using-Tweets" project also involves the use of various machine learning models. Models such as Random Forest and Linear Regression were utilized to predict TV viewership based on the sentiment score of each episode, which was treated as a feature. The project was implemented using both Jupyter Notebook and PyCharm, two popular tools for data analysis and machine learning. By leveraging these tools and techniques, the project aimed to accurately predict TV viewership using Twitter sentiment analysis and machine learning, with the potential to provide valuable insights for TV networks and advertisers.
